# Introduction

The aim of this project is to create a package that can produce figures that
are aesthetically cohesive for a textbook in an automatic and reproducible
manner. As these graphs are generally aimed to be consumed by other people, it
is important for the aesthetics to be engaging. More importantly, the style of 
the graphs needs to make it easier for users to compare and explore data.

There are two styles that will be proposed for this project. These styles
are built upon existing themes from `ggplot2`.

# theme_wombat

```{r wombat-scatter, fig.cap="A scatter plot example with 'theme_wombat()'"}
w1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg,disp,color=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_point(size=3) + 
  labs(title="Scatter Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_wombat()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  #scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.03,0.03)) + 
  #scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01,0.01)) +
  theme_wombat()

w1
```

The first figure aesthetic variant is called `theme_wombat()`. Figure 
\@ref(fig:wombat-scatter) shows a scatter plot that has been applied with 
`theme_wombat()`. This theme is built upon ggplot2 basic theme `theme_bw()`. One 
of the main goals of this style is to reduce clutter of plots. This is achieved 
by:

* Removing minor grid lines in the x and y axis
* Maximising white space to improve legibility
* Removing extra space around the plot
* Move legend position to the bottom of the plot
* Having a bigger plot title, subtitle, and axis title

Side by side comparison of scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts between
`theme_wombat` and `theme_bw()` can be found in figure \@ref(fig:wombat-comparison).
Figure \@ref(fig:wombat-facet) shows the comparison of faceted plot between
these two themes.

```{r wombat-comparison, fig.cap="Comparison between 'theme_wombat()' and 'theme_bw()'", fig.height=15, fig.width=11}
w2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(carb),fill=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title="Bar Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_wombat()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  theme_wombat()

w3 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(date, value01, colour = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
   scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
   scale_x_date(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title = "Line Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_wombat()",
       caption = "Data: economics_long") +
  theme_wombat()

bw1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg,disp,color=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_point(size=3) + 
  labs(title="Scatter Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_bw()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  theme_bw()

bw2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(carb),fill=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title="Bar Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_bw()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  theme_bw()

bw3 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(date, value01, colour = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Line Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_bw()",
       caption = "Data: economics_long") +
  theme_bw()

(w1 + bw1) / (w2 + bw2) / (w3 + bw3)
```

```{r wombat-facet, fig.height=15, fig.width=11, fig.cap="Comparison between 'theme_wombat()' and 'theme_bw()' for faceted plot"}
w4 <- ggplot(data = mpg,aes(cty, hwy,color=drv))+geom_point(size=3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class,scales="free")+
  labs(title="Plot With Facets",
       subtitle = "theme_wombat()",
       caption = "Data: mpg") + 
  theme_wombat()

bw4 <- ggplot(data = mpg,aes(cty, hwy,color=drv))+geom_point(size=3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class,scales="free")+
  labs(title="Plot With Facets",
       subtitle = "theme_bw()",
       caption = "Data: mpg") + 
  theme_bw()

w4 / bw4
```

# theme_seagull

```{r seagull-scatter, fig.cap="A scatter plot example with 'theme_seagull()'"}
s1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg,disp,color=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_point(size=3) + 
  labs(title="Scatter Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_seagull()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  #scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0.03,0.03)) + 
  #scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0.01,0.01)) +
  theme_seagull()

s1
```

Another proposed figure style is `theme_seagull()`. An example of plot applied
with this style is shown in figure \@ref(fig:seagull-scatter). This theme is built
based on ggplot2 `theme_minmal()`. In comparison to `theme_wombat()`, this style
reduce clutter within a plot even further. The following adjustments are made
to the original `theme_minimal()`:

* Adding a major grid line on the x axis
* Removing minor grid lines on the x and y axis
* Maximising white space to improve legibility
* Removing extra space around the plot
* Move legend position to the bottom of the plot
* Having a bigger plot title, subtitle, and axis title

```{r seagull-comparison, fig.cap="Comparison between 'theme_seagull()' and 'theme_minimal()'", fig.height=15, fig.width=11}
s2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(carb),fill=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_x_discrete(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title="Bar Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_seagull()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  theme_seagull()

s3 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(date, value01, colour = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) + 
  scale_x_continuous(expand = c(0,0)) +
  labs(title = "Line Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_seagull()",
       caption = "Data: economics_long") +
  theme_seagull()

m1 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(mpg,disp,color=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_point(size=3) + 
  labs(title="Scatter Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_minimal()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  theme_minimal()

m2 <- ggplot(mtcars, aes(factor(carb),fill=factor(carb))) + 
  geom_bar() + 
  labs(title="Bar Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_minimal()",
       caption = "Data: mtcars") +
  theme_minimal()

m3 <- ggplot(economics_long, aes(date, value01, colour = variable)) +
  geom_line() +
  labs(title = "Line Plot",
       subtitle = "theme_minimal()",
       caption = "Data: economics_long") +
  theme_minimal()

(s1 + m1) / (s2 + m2) / (s3 + m3)
```

```{r seagull-facet, fig.height=15, fig.width=11, fig.cap="Comparison between 'theme_seagull()' and 'theme_minimal()' for faceted plot"}
s4 <- ggplot(data = mpg,aes(cty, hwy,color=drv))+geom_point(size=3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class,scales="free")+
  labs(title="Plot With Facets",
       subtitle = "theme_seagull()",
       caption = "Data: mpg") + 
  theme_seagull()

m4 <- ggplot(data = mpg,aes(cty, hwy,color=drv))+geom_point(size=3) + 
  facet_wrap(~ class,scales="free")+
  labs(title="Plot With Facets",
       subtitle = "theme_minimal()",
       caption = "Data: mpg") + 
  theme_minimal()

s4 / m4
```

Side by side comparison of scatter plots, bar charts, and line charts between
`theme_seagull()` and `theme_minimal()` can be found in figure 
\@ref(fig:seagull-comparison). Figure \@ref(fig:wombat-facet) shows the 
comparison of faceted plot between these two themes.
